# GitHub Actions Firewall Fix

## Problem
GitHub Actions was blocking Composer from downloading dependencies from `api.github.com` due to firewall restrictions. The error messages showed:

```
Warning: Firewall rules blocked me from connecting to one or more addresses
I tried to connect to the following addresses, but was blocked by firewall rules:
https://api.github.com/repos/laminas/laminas-servicemanager/zipball/...
https://api.github.com/repos/php-fig/container/zipball/...
...
```

## Solution
Fixed by implementing multiple strategies to work around firewall restrictions:

### 1. Enhanced GitHub Authentication
- Added `COMPOSER_TOKEN` environment variable during PHP setup
- Added `COMPOSER_AUTH` with GitHub OAuth token during dependency installation
- This ensures Composer can authenticate with GitHub API to avoid rate limits

### 2. Optimized Download Strategy
- Using `--prefer-dist` flag to download zip files instead of cloning repositories
- This is more firewall-friendly and faster in CI environments

### 3. Improved Caching
- Enhanced cache configuration to include both Composer cache directory and vendor directory
- Reduces the need to download dependencies on subsequent runs

### 4. Fallback Testing
- Added fallback to run tests inside Docker containers if host-based tests fail
- This provides an alternative path if dependency installation still has issues

### 5. Updated composer.json
- Added proper package metadata (name, description, license)
- Fixed version constraints to use semantic versioning ranges

## Key Changes

### `.github/workflows/php.yml`
- Added `COMPOSER_TOKEN` in PHP setup environment
- Added `COMPOSER_AUTH` for dependency installation
- Simplified Composer configuration
- Added vendor directory to cache paths
- Added Docker-based test fallback

### `organizer/src/composer.json`
- Added package metadata
- Fixed laminas/laminas-mail version constraint

## Testing
The fix should be validated by running the GitHub Actions workflow and ensuring:
1. Composer dependencies install successfully
2. Tests run without firewall-related errors
3. If host tests fail, Docker fallback executes

This fix addresses the core issue while providing multiple fallback mechanisms for reliability.
